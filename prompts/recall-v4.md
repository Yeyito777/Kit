Which memories are relevant to this user prompt? Be selective — only recall memories whose specific content would be needed to handle the task well. When multiple memories cover similar topics, pick only the ones that directly apply rather than everything in the same area. Output ONLY the filenames (one per line, e.g. memory/foo-bar.md). No explanations, no markdown, no numbering. If none apply, output nothing.
