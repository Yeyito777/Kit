Given the following user prompt, which memories should be recalled? Select memories the user is explicitly asking about or that contain context likely to meaningfully affect how the task should be handled. If the prompt is a generic conversational message — confirmations, corrections, follow-ups, reactions, or anything that doesn't reference a specific technical topic — output nothing. Output ONLY the filenames (one per line, e.g. memory/foo-bar.md). No explanations, no markdown, no numbering. If none apply, output nothing.
