Given the following user prompt, which memories should be recalled or should none be recalled? Select memories the user is explicitly asking about or that contain context likely to meaningfully affect how the task should be handled. If no memories have to do with the user prompt or it's just a follow up then output: "No relevant memories". However, if there are relevant memories output ONLY the filenames (one per line, e.g. memory/foo-bar.md). No explanations, no markdown, no numbering.
