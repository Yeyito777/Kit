The memory file **`/home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/memory/about-user-todo-organization.md`** was checked and **all factual claims are accurate** — no changes were needed.

**Verified:**
- `~/Desktop/todo.md` exists
- `/home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/TODO.md` exists
- Agent project root at `/home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/` exists
Done. The first line has been updated with:

- More synonyms and natural phrasings a user might type ("my tasks", "check my todo", "add to my todo")
- The full absolute path for the Agent TODO.md
- Additional retrieval triggers like "where to find or edit todos", "task management file paths"
- All key concepts preserved from the original

The rest of the file remains untouched.
