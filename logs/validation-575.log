The memory file **`user-terminal-aesthetics.md`** was verified and is **fully accurate** — no changes were needed.

Here's what the subagent checked:

| Claim | Verification method | Result |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Reference to `user-terminal-color-scheme.md` | Confirmed file exists via Glob | Accurate |
| Color names (lagoon aqua, aqua splash, seafoam teal) | Cross-referenced palette in `user-terminal-color-scheme.md` and hex values in `Config/st/config.h` | Accurate |
| "6-line block letters" | Read `src/start.sh` lines 12–17; confirmed 6 printf lines | Accurate |
| Vertical gradient order | Verified RGB escape codes: `#48cae4` → `#00b4d8` → `#2ec4b6` | Accurate |
| ASCII art content | Character-by-character comparison against `start.sh` | Accurate |
Done. The first line inside `<memory>` has been updated from a sentence-style description to a keyword-rich, synonym-packed pointer that covers all major topics in the file:

- **Before:** `The user prefers bold, high-impact terminal aesthetics with large ASCII art, vertical color gradients, and strong visual branding across CLI tools and scripts.`
- **After:** `Terminal aesthetics — ASCII art, block letters, CLI banners, splash screens, startup branding, vertical color gradients, ocean palette, bold high-impact visuals, "make it look nice" terminal output, script headers, CLI tool identity and visual design preferences`

Key improvements:
- Front-loaded nouns and tool concepts (`Terminal aesthetics`, `ASCII art`, `block letters`)
- Added synonyms/alternate phrasings users might type (`splash screens`, `startup branding`, `script headers`, `"make it look nice"`)
- Mentioned the ocean palette reference
- Covered all subtopics from the file (banners, gradients, branding, visual identity)
- No markdown formatting, single line of plaintext
