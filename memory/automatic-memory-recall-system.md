<memory>
The automatic memory system uses three hook-driven subagents to recall, update, and forget memories across sessions. Each agent is toggled independently via `agent.conf` and spawns a `claude -p` subclaude to do its work. Memories live as markdown files in `memory/` with embedded metadata, and the session counter ensures usage-based tracking rather than counting idle opens.

## Overview

Three subagents handle the memory lifecycle:

1. **Recall agent** -- A `UserPromptSubmit` hook spawns a one-shot `claude -p --model opus` call to determine which memories are relevant to the user's prompt. Relevant memories are surfaced once per session via deduplication. Toggle: `MEMORY_RECALL=on|off`.
2. **Update agent** -- A `Stop` hook (async) spawns a subclaude after every response that reviews the conversation transcript and updates or creates memories if new persistent information was discussed. Toggle: `MEMORY_UPDATE=on|off`.
3. **Forgetting agent** -- A `SessionStart` hook (async) spawns a subclaude on a configurable schedule (via `MEMORY_FORGETTING_SCHEDULE`, default `0/200` meaning session % 200 == 0) to review the lowest-scoring memories and either archive them to `memory-cold/` or bump their appreciation. Toggle: `MEMORY_FORGETTING=on|off`.

## Shell launcher (`src/start.sh`, aliased as `agent` in `~/.zshrc`)

The launcher sets up the session environment before handing off to Claude:

1. `cd` to Agent project
2. Generates `AGENT_HOOK_ID` via `openssl rand -hex 4` (8 hex chars), exports it
3. Captures `AGENT_TERMINAL_PID` by walking up the process tree: first looks for an ancestor named `st`, falls back to first ancestor owning an X window. Exported for hooks to use with `st-notify`
4. Runs `python3 src/reconcile_metadata.py` to ensure all memory files have in-file metadata tags
5. Sends a pink st-notify toast showing the upcoming session number (current counter + 1)
6. Creates `runtime/recalled-<id>` (dedup ledger) and `runtime/hook-<id>.log` (debug log)
7. Launches `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`

## Session counter

Tracks how many sessions have been actively used (not just opened).

- `runtime/session-counter` persists across sessions, starts at 0
- Incremented on the **first message** of each session (not on launch), so accidental opens don't count
- The recall hook compares `AGENT_HOOK_ID` against `runtime/session-last-increment` to detect first-message-of-session
- On launch, `start.sh` shows a preview notification with `counter + 1` (the number it will become)

## In-file memory structure

Each `memory/*.md` file uses XML tags to organize metadata, recall hints, and content:

```
<memory-metadata>
{
  "frequency": 5,
  "last_accessed_session": 42,
  "created_session": 30,
  "appreciation": 0,
  "pinned": false
}
</memory-metadata>

<conditional>
Recall if the user prompt mentions X, Y, or Z.
</conditional>

<fuzzy-match>
keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
</fuzzy-match>

<memory>
First line = plaintext description for recall pointers (when <conditional> is absent).
...actual memory content...
</memory>
```

### Tag roles

- **`<memory-metadata>`** -- JSON block with usage tracking fields. Managed by the pipeline, never edited manually by the main Claude session or subagents.
  - `frequency` -- incremented each time the recall hook surfaces the memory
  - `last_accessed_session` -- updated to current session on each recall
  - `created_session` -- set when metadata is first created
  - `appreciation` -- bonus score, set manually or by the forgetting agent to protect a memory
  - `pinned` -- if true, the forgetting agent will never consider this memory for archival
- **`<conditional>`** -- A one-line natural-language condition describing when this memory should be recalled. This is the **primary** text used by `get_description()` to generate recall pointers shown to the LLM. Example: "Recall if the user prompt mentions memory recall, hook agents, or agent.conf."
- **`<fuzzy-match>`** -- Comma-separated keywords used by the presearch filter (`presearch.py`) to narrow candidates before the LLM pass. Matched against user prompt tokens via word-boundary, substring, and SequenceMatcher fuzzy matching.
- **`<memory>`** -- The actual memory content. First line inside `<memory>` serves as a fallback description if `<conditional>` is absent.

### Key Python module: `src/memory_metadata.py`

Shared Python module for all in-file tag operations. Has a CLI interface for use from bash scripts. Key functions:
- `read_metadata()` / `write_metadata()` -- read/write the `<memory-metadata>` JSON block
- `ensure_file()` / `ensure_structure()` -- add missing tags to a memory file (used by reconcile)
- `get_description()` -- returns `<conditional>` content if present, falls back to first line of `<memory>`, then first non-tag line, then filename stem
- `get_fuzzy_match()` -- returns list of keywords from `<fuzzy-match>` tag (empty list if absent)
- `get_memory_content()` -- returns only the text inside `<memory>` tags (used by the `recall` command)

`src/reconcile_metadata.py` ensures every memory file has `<memory-metadata>` and `<memory>` tags (adds defaults if missing). Runs at every session start via `start.sh`. If a new memory is created without tags, reconcile adds them automatically.

## Presearch filter (`src/presearch.py`)

An optional keyword pre-filter that runs before the LLM recall pass to narrow the candidate list. Enabled via `MEMORY_RECALL_PRESEARCH=on` in `agent.conf` (default: off).

Flow:
1. Tokenizes the user prompt, removes stop words (extensive built-in list)
2. For each memory file, builds a search text from `<fuzzy-match>` keywords + filename stem (falls back to stem + `get_description()` if no `<fuzzy-match>` tag)
3. Matches prompt keywords against search text using three tiers: exact word-boundary, substring, and SequenceMatcher fuzzy (threshold 0.95)
4. A memory matches if ANY keyword hits -- outputs matching pointers to stdout
5. If `MEMORY_RECALL_PRESEARCH_CONTENT=on`, includes full file content in search text too

When presearch is off, all memory pointers are passed to the LLM (no filtering).

## Standalone recall script (`src/recall.sh`)

This is the source of truth for recall logic. Takes a user prompt on stdin, outputs recalled `memory/*.md` filenames to stdout (one per line). Used by the hook and by `benchmark/recall/run-benchmark.sh`.

It supports two schemes configured via `agent.conf`:

**Single scheme** (`MEMORY_RECALL_SCHEME=single`):
1. Generates memory pointers via `memory_metadata.get_description()` (reads `<conditional>` content, falls back to first line inside `<memory>` tags)
2. If presearch is on, filters pointers through `presearch.py` first
3. Loads prompt template from `prompts/<name>.md` (first name in `MEMORY_RECALL_PROMPTS`)
4. Calls `claude -p --model <MODEL1> --max-turns 1 --no-session-persistence` with pointers + user prompt
5. Parses response: validates files exist on disk, outputs valid filenames

**Double scheme** (`MEMORY_RECALL_SCHEME=double`, default):
1. **Pass 1 (broad candidate selection):** Same as single -- generates pointers (optionally presearch-filtered), loads first prompt template, calls `MODEL1`. Biased toward overrecall.
2. **Pass 2 (re-rank with full content):** Reads the full content of each pass 1 candidate, loads second prompt template, calls `MODEL2`. Filters to only memories whose specific content is actually needed. Can return nothing if no candidates are truly relevant.
3. Pass 2 results are constrained to pass 1 candidates (can only remove, not add). On pass 2 failure, falls back to pass 1 results.

All inner `claude -p` calls run with `AGENT_HOOK_ID=""` and `BLOCK_HOOK_AGENTS=1` (see gotchas below).

Prompt templates live in `prompts/` as `.md` files. The script appends `<user_prompt>` tags and `Available memories:` (pass 1) or `Candidate memories:` with full content (pass 2).

Current prompt templates: `recall-v3.md`, `recall-v4.md`, `recall-v5-pass1.md`, `recall-v5-pass2.md`, `recall-v6.md`, `recall-v6-pass2.md`, `recall-v7.md`.

## Recall hook (`src/hooks/recall-memories.sh`)

Wired as `UserPromptSubmit` in `.claude/settings.local.json` (60s timeout, "Recalling memories..." spinner). Delegates core recall to `src/recall.sh`.

Flow per message:
1. On first message of session: increments session counter, writes hook ID to `runtime/session-last-increment`
2. Validates `AGENT_HOOK_ID` and tracking file exist (exit 2 if not -- blocks prompt, notifies user)
3. Extracts prompt from stdin JSON via `jq`
4. Pipes prompt into `src/recall.sh`, captures output
5. Deduplicates against `recalled-<id>` ledger
6. For each recalled memory, updates its in-file metadata via `memory_metadata.py`: increments `frequency`, sets `last_accessed_session`
7. New memories appended to tracking file, output as `Relevant memories: memory/foo.md memory/bar.md`
8. If memories were recalled and `AGENT_TERMINAL_PID` is set, fires one `st-notify` toast per memory (teal border on dark green bg, backgrounded)
9. stdout with exit 0 = context injected into the main Claude session

## `recall` command (`src/memory/recall`)

A bash script placed on `PATH` by `start.sh` (via `PATH="${AGENT_DIR}/src/memory:$PATH"`). Used by the main Claude session to load memory content after the hook surfaces filenames. Extracts only the text inside `<memory>` tags using `memory_metadata.get_memory_content()`, keeping metadata and recall hints out of the context window.

Usage: `recall memory/foo.md` or `recall foo.md` or `recall foo`

## Resume hook (inline in `.claude/settings.local.json`)

Wired to `SessionStart` with `"matcher": "resume"`. Truncates `runtime/recalled-<id>` so the dedup ledger resets on session resume. This allows all memories to be re-surfaced when switching between sessions, since the previous session's conversation context may no longer be present.

## Memory update hook (`src/hooks/update-memories.sh`)

Wired as `Stop` in `.claude/settings.local.json` with `async: true` (300s timeout). Runs in the background after every Claude response.

Flow:
1. Reads `transcript_path` from stdin JSON
2. Extracts last 50 user/assistant messages from the JSONL transcript via python
3. Generates current memory pointers
4. Spawns `claude -p --model opus --max-turns 15 --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write,Glob,Bash(python3 *)"` with a strict system prompt
5. System prompt emphasizes: if nothing needs updating, exit immediately without touching files
6. The subclaude is instructed to only edit content inside `<memory>` tags and never touch `<memory-metadata>` tags
7. All output logged to `runtime/hook-<id>.log` with `[update]` prefix

## Forgetting hook (`src/hooks/forgetting-memories.sh`)

Wired as `SessionStart` in `.claude/settings.local.json` with `async: true` (300s timeout). Fires on every session start (new or resume).

Flow:
1. Checks `MEMORY_FORGETTING` toggle in `agent.conf`
2. Reads `runtime/session-counter` for current session number
3. Reads `MEMORY_FORGETTING_SCHEDULE` from `agent.conf` (default `0/200`), parses as `offset/cycle`, skips if `session % cycle != offset`; compares against `runtime/last-forgetting-session` lock to prevent duplicate runs
4. On first-ever run, initializes `last-forgetting-session` and exits (no cleanup on first use)
5. Sends pink st-notify toast: "Memory forgetting started" (45s, `#ff6b9d` border, `#1a0010` bg)
6. Spawns `claude -p --model opus --max-turns 30 --dangerously-skip-permissions` with `PATH` prepended to include `src/memory/` (for `forget-memory` and `appreciate-memory` commands)
7. The forgetting agent:
   - Runs a Python scoring snippet: `score = log2(1 + freq) * e^(-0.003466 * sessions_since_last_access) + appreciation` (200-session half-life)
   - Reviews bottom 3 non-pinned memories by reading their content
   - Decides per memory: bump appreciation (keep) or `mv` to `memory-cold/` (archive)
   - Sends per-memory pink st-notify toasts for each archived memory: "Forgot memory/{name}.md"

## Validation hook (`src/hooks/validation-memories.sh`)

Wired as `SessionStart` in `.claude/settings.local.json` with `async: true`. Fires on a configurable schedule (default `75/100`, i.e. session % 100 == 75). Toggle: `MEMORY_VALIDATION=on|off`.

Flow:
1. Schedule and lock gating (same pattern as forgetting hook)
2. Selects up to `MEMORY_VALIDATION_AMOUNT` (default 20) random memories
3. Sends blue st-notify toast: "Memory validation started"
4. **Phase 1 (content validation):** Spawns a subclaude that fans out subagents, one per memory file. Each subagent reads the memory, verifies factual claims against actual files/commands/configs on disk, and fixes outdated information. Only edits content inside `<memory>` tags.
5. **Phase 2 (descriptor update):** Spawns a second subclaude that reads each memory's full content and rewrites the first line inside `<memory>` to maximize recall retrieval quality.
6. Output logged to `logs/validation-<session>.log`

## Cold storage (`memory-cold/`)

When the forgetting agent archives a memory, the file is moved from `memory/{name}.md` to `memory-cold/{name}.md` (metadata travels with the file since it's embedded).

To restore: move the file back to `memory/`. The next reconciliation pass picks it up.

## Cleanup hook (`src/hooks/cleanup-runtime.sh`)

Wired to `SessionEnd`. Deletes `runtime/recalled-<id>` and `runtime/hook-<id>.log`.

## Configuration

`agent.conf` at project root controls which subagents are active:
```
MEMORY_RECALL=on       # recall agent (UserPromptSubmit)
MEMORY_UPDATE=on       # update agent (Stop, async)
MEMORY_FORGETTING=on   # forgetting agent (SessionStart, async)
MEMORY_VALIDATION=on   # validation agent (SessionStart, async)
```
Set to `off` to disable. Checked on every hook invocation -- no restart needed.

Recall agent settings:
```
MEMORY_RECALL_SCHEME=double              # single or double (two-pass)
MEMORY_RECALL_MODELS=opus/opus           # model1/model2 (single uses model1 only)
MEMORY_RECALL_PROMPTS=recall-v5-pass1/recall-v5-pass2  # prompt names from prompts/ dir (single uses first only)
MEMORY_RECALL_PRESEARCH=off              # on to enable keyword pre-filter before LLM pass
MEMORY_RECALL_PRESEARCH_CONTENT=off      # on to include full file content in presearch matching
```
Prompt templates are stored in `prompts/` as `.md` files (e.g. `prompts/recall-v5-pass1.md`). The name in the config omits the `.md` extension.

Hook schedules are also configurable in `agent.conf` as `offset/cycle` (fires when `session % cycle == offset`):
```
MEMORY_FORGETTING_SCHEDULE=0/200    # fires at session % 200 == 0
MEMORY_VALIDATION_SCHEDULE=75/100   # fires at session % 100 == 75
```
If absent, hooks fall back to the defaults shown above.

## Known gotchas

1. **Hook recursion:** The inner `claude -p` runs in the same project and inherits `.claude/settings.local.json` hooks. Without `BLOCK_HOOK_AGENTS=1`, the inner session's `UserPromptSubmit` fires the recall hook again -- which either blocks it (exit 2 from missing AGENT_HOOK_ID) or recurses infinitely. Every hook checks `BLOCK_HOOK_AGENTS` at the very top and exits 0 immediately if set.
2. **SessionEnd cascade:** Without `AGENT_HOOK_ID=""`, the inner `claude -p` finishing triggers `cleanup-runtime.sh`, which deletes the main session's tracking file mid-session. The cleanup and resume hooks don't check `BLOCK_HOOK_AGENTS` but are independently protected by the empty `AGENT_HOOK_ID`.
3. **`--allowedTools` Bash patterns are unreliable in `-p` mode:** `Bash(cmd *)` patterns for custom scripts silently fail -- the agent runs but Bash tool calls get denied with "needs your approval" (which can't be granted in non-interactive `-p` mode). Tested: bare names, colon syntax, absolute paths -- none worked. For subagents that need Bash, use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` instead and constrain behavior through the prompt and `--max-turns`. Standard tool names (Read, Edit, Write, Glob) work fine in `--allowedTools`.

## Debugging

Watch the log in real time from another terminal:
```
tail -f runtime/hook-*.log
```
Log shows: prompt received, pointer count, opus response, each memory's accept/reject/dedup status, final output.
