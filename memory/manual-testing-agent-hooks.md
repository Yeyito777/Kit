How to manually test Agent hooks in an isolated temp clone, covering environment setup, invocation patterns, bash -x tracing, mock memories, runtime state control, notification testing, and sandbox pitfalls.

## Setup

Clone the Agent directory into a unique temp directory so all tests run against the clone. This isolates the live system from broken hooks, corrupted metadata, or accidental memory deletion. A unique suffix avoids collisions with other agents testing concurrently.

```bash
TEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/Agent-test.XXXXXX)
cp -r /home/yeyito/Workspace/Agent/* "$TEST_DIR"/
```

## Path resolution

- `src/reconcile_metadata.py` uses `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` -- auto-resolves to the clone, no edits needed.
- Hook scripts use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -- pass it as an env var when invoking manually.
- `start.sh` has a hardcoded `AGENT_DIR` -- not used during manual hook testing (hooks use `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`).

## Running hooks manually

Hooks expect specific env vars and stdin. Write stdin to a file and redirect -- **do not pipe** `echo '{}' |` because Claude Code wraps commands in zsh `eval` which can corrupt multi-line piped commands:

```bash
echo '{}' > /tmp/hook-input.json
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR="$TEST_DIR" \
  AGENT_HOOK_ID="test01" \
  AGENT_TERMINAL_PID="" \
  bash "$TEST_DIR/src/hooks/forgetting-memories.sh" < /tmp/hook-input.json 2>&1
```

Key env vars:
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -- the clone path (hooks derive all paths from this).
- `AGENT_HOOK_ID` -- any test value; hooks use it for log filenames and session tracking.
- `AGENT_TERMINAL_PID` -- set to an st PID for notification testing, empty to skip notifications.
- `BLOCK_HOOK_AGENTS` -- leave unset (setting it causes hooks to exit immediately).

Create the hook's expected runtime files before invoking:

```bash
mkdir -p "$TEST_DIR/runtime"
touch "$TEST_DIR/runtime/hook-test01.log"
touch "$TEST_DIR/runtime/recalled-test01"
```

## Testing notifications

Spawn an st window in debug mode to see notification output:

```bash
st -d -e sleep 120 &>/tmp/st-debug.log &
ST_PID=$!
## Use ST_PID as AGENT_TERMINAL_PID when invoking hooks
## Check: cat /tmp/st-debug.log
```

## Using bash -x for tracing

When a hook isn't behaving as expected, run with `bash -x`. **Do not pipe through `tail`** -- if the hook spawns `claude -p`, the pipe keeps the parent process alive indefinitely. Redirect to a file instead:

```bash
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR="$TEST_DIR" AGENT_HOOK_ID="test01" \
  bash -x "$TEST_DIR/src/hooks/some-hook.sh" < /tmp/hook-input.json > /tmp/trace.txt 2>&1
cat /tmp/trace.txt
```

## Mock memories

Replace `$TEST_DIR/memory/*.md` with purpose-built test files:
- Clearly disposable memories (outdated info, notes that say "can delete").
- Clearly important memories (architecture docs, critical references).
- Edge cases (pinned memories with low scores).

Ensure metadata tags exist (reconcile adds `<memory-metadata>` and `<memory>` tags to any file missing them):

```bash
python3 "$TEST_DIR/src/reconcile_metadata.py"
```

Then overwrite the in-file `<memory-metadata>` JSON with known test values.

## Controlling runtime state

Use `printf` (not `echo`) and **chain with `&&`** -- multi-line commands in Claude Code's zsh eval can concatenate into a single line, corrupting file contents:

```bash
printf '200' > "$TEST_DIR/runtime/session-counter" && printf '0' > "$TEST_DIR/runtime/last-forgetting-session"
```

Trigger/skip examples:
- `printf '200' > session-counter && printf '0' > last-forgetting-session` -- triggers (200%200==0, lock!=200).
- `printf '200' > session-counter && printf '200' > last-forgetting-session` -- skips (lock==200, already ran).
- `rm -f last-forgetting-session` -- first-ever run (initializes).
- `printf '175' > session-counter && printf '75' > last-validation-session` -- triggers (175%100==75, lock!=175).

**Always verify** after writing: `cat "$TEST_DIR/runtime/session-counter"` -- corrupted values (e.g. `400 echo 200 echo {}`) cause `set -u` failures that are hard to diagnose.

## Testing hooks that spawn claude -p

These hooks actually call the Claude API and cost money. Test the logic around the spawn first (interval checks, scoring, env setup) using `bash -x` traces. Only run the full agent when the surrounding logic is verified.

## Sandbox gotchas

- Hooks that spawn `claude -p` fail with **exit 126** (permission denied) in Claude Code's sandbox. Use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` for manual tests that need the full agent.
- `run_in_background` launches in a subshell -- shell functions defined in the command body (e.g. `create_mock()`) don't affect the filesystem if the command is stopped or the subshell exits early. Prefer using the `Write` tool for creating test files.
- Metadata JSON files written via `echo "$VAR" > file.json` in multi-command bash blocks can get corrupted by zsh eval. Use the `Write` tool for JSON files.

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf "$TEST_DIR" /tmp/hook-input.json /tmp/trace.txt
```

## Forgetting agent behavior profile

From manual testing with mock memories (3 rounds, 9 memories total):

**Archives** -- generic reference material with zero user-specific content:
- Completed/expired action items, one-off scripts, generic cheat sheets (python venv, git rebase).

**Keeps (+1)** -- borderline, but has some user-specific detail mixed in:
- Generic templates that include user paths (`/home/yeyito/apps/`).
- Cheat sheets that note a user preference ("prefers yay over paru").
- Debug notes with specific IPs and resolutions.

**Keeps (+2)** -- confidently valuable, entirely user-specific:
- Network topology with IPs, VLANs, service assignments.
- Backup/restore procedures with specific paths and schedules.

**Decision boundary**: the agent forgets anything googleable with no user-specific details. The moment a memory contains user-specific information (IPs, paths, preferences, infrastructure), it tips to keep -- even if the surrounding content is generic.

Update this memory when the manual testing methodology or Agent hook structure changes.
