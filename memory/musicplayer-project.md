MusicPlayer — minimal C-based TUI music player at ~/Workspace/MusicPlayer with vim keybindings, mpv backend, IPC control, and installation to ~/.local/bin

MusicPlayer is a minimal TUI (terminal user interface) music player written in C. Located at ~/Workspace/MusicPlayer.

**Architecture & Dependencies:**
- Uses the alt screen buffer for the TUI display
- Audio playback handled by spawning mpv as a subprocess
- IPC communication with mpv via Unix socket at /tmp/musicplayer-mpv.sock for seek and pause commands

**Navigation & Controls (vim-style):**
- j/k — move up/down in song list
- g — go to top
- G — go to bottom
- Enter / Space — play selected song
- h — seek backward 5 seconds
- l — seek forward 5 seconds
- -/+ — volume down/up
- m — toggle loop single/all
- n — toggle shuffle
- / or ? — enter search filter (regex, case-insensitive). Enter keeps filter, Escape clears it
- Ctrl+M — toggle playlist sidebar (right-side panel, CSI sequence `\033[109;5u` from st)
- Space — pause/resume (when playing)
- Escape — stop playback
- q — quit the player

**Playlists:**
- `.playlist` files in `playlists/` directory (overridable via `PLAYLISTS_DIR` env var)
- Each file contains song filenames line-by-line
- Ctrl+M toggles a right-side sidebar with vim navigation (j/k/g/G), Enter selects, Escape closes
- Selecting a playlist filters the song list; search with `/` operates within the active playlist
- Header shows active playlist name in brackets: `MusicPlayer [name]`

**Installation & Usage:**
- Binary installs to ~/.local/bin/musicplayer via `make install`
- Zsh alias 'mp' defined in ~/.zshrc: cds to project directory and runs the player
- Songs stored in songs/ directory (which is gitignored)
