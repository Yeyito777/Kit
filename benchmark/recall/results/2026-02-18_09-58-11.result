I'm trying to debug why my forgetting hook isn't triggering at the right session interval. I set session-counter to 400 and last-forgetting-session to 0, but it seems like the values are getting corrupted. Can you walk me through how to manually test this in an isolated environment?

I'm trying to manually test my forgetting-memories hook but it keeps failing silently. I'm running it with `echo '{"test": true}' | bash src/hooks/forgetting-memories.sh` and setting CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to my test clone. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
