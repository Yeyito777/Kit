# About memory/
You have memories stored in memory/ as kebab case markdown files.

## Recalling memories
A `UserPromptSubmit` hook runs on every user message. It surfaces relevant memory filenames in a `<system-reminder>` tag like:
```
Relevant memories: memory/foo.md memory/bar.md
```

**IMPORTANT — your FIRST action after seeing recalled memories must be to use the `recall` bash command to load the ones relevant to the task. (This command is in your path you can call it directly)** Do this BEFORE any other work (reading reference files, writing code, etc.). The recall skill returns only the `<memory>` content, keeping your context clean. These memories contain critical context about the user's setup, preferences, and workflows that directly affect how you should approach the task.

Usage:
```bash
recall memory/<memory-filename>
```

# Creating memories
If the user requests you to create a memory you must follow the following guideline:
1. Create a kebab case markdown file in memory/ with a descriptive filename
2. Write only the memory content — just the text. The metadata pipeline will automatically add `<memory-metadata>` and `<memory>` tags on the next session start.
3. The first line must be a plaintext description that maximizes retrieval — it is the ONLY text the recall agent sees when deciding relevance. Front-load key nouns, tools, and concepts (e.g. "st-notify popup notification system — usage, options, wire protocol" not "How notifications work"). Include synonyms and related terms a user might mention. Keep it single-lined.
4. Footer of the memory should be instructions on how to update the memory if anything becomes outdated
5. When editing existing memories, only modify content inside `<memory>` tags. Never modify `<memory-metadata>` tags — those are managed by the pipeline.
